Simple 2D game engine built off Monogame, made in C#.

Current Toolset: 

- The engine (this repository)

- Pest Control Animator (used for creating animation files used in-engine to play animations): https://github.com/JamDoggie/PestControlAnimator

- Pest Control Mapper (used for map/level creation): https://github.com/JamDoggie/PestControlMapper

This hasn't been touched in a long time, but it's still fun to look around the source code.
The tooling is mostly made in WPF and it's definitely a little rough around the edges, but I even had a networking implementation in here at some point.
